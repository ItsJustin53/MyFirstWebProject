        I like to look at dank memes and watch YouTube videos of League of Legends. My
   favorite subject in school is Math, currently Algebra 1. My favorite color is
    magenta. I have 2 younger brothers that are really annoying. My life in a
    nutshell... Boring. My favorite cartoon is, "Dexters Labratory," shown below.
    I also enjoyed learning about web development and all its applicable uses.
    Overall, this course was very helpful too, it allowed to be able to read any
     html code and understand everything it is trying to say. Being in the RWC
     program has made me a more experienced individual and I will have a better
     future in college because of it. I love RWC and all it lets me learn and
     experience and how it is going to help my highschool and colege future.
